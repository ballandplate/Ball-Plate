# Introduction
The ball and plate is an example of how control systems work, due to the fact that creating a balancing systems is difficult to execute. In such system, a ball is on top of a flat plate. When the ball is moved to any other point than the center of the plate the plate itself uses motion to contradict the balls movement and ultimately moving the ball to its original position, the center of the plate.
